# SDEV140_Final_Project
Final Project for SDEV140

**MAIN PYTHON CODE:**

  In order to run the code effectively, you need to download a few modules using
  the command terminal in Windows. Copy and paste what I have below:
  
  pip install BeautifulSoup4
  
  pip install requests
  
  pip install pillow
  
  If you see yellow text with a file path, copy everything between the quotation marks and follow the next steps:
  
  1. Press your Windows key and navigate to the search box
  2. Search "Environment Variables"
  3. Click "Edit the System Environment Variables"
  4. Click "Environment Variables..."
  5. In the top box, double-click "PATH"
  6. In the first available slot, paste the text you copied from the command prompt.
  7. Restart your computer(optional)
  

  

**PICTURES:**

  To make sure that the pictures work, drag the into your current working directory. If you don't know
  what file path that is, you can run the following command in an empty python window to get your 
  current working directory:

  import os
  
  print(os.getcwd())



You can open the Python file and run it, and you should have no problems. If you have any issues, contact Jaylen at jbolden20@ivytech.edu.
